# Last Light
Last Light is an action entry for the Ludum Dare 46 Game Jam with the theme 'Keep it Alive'

## About the game
In this game your goal is to keep the fire alive, it is the last light! If it dies it's game over. Monsters will try and destroy it and you are the only person that can save it! There is a shop where you can upgrade the fire and yourself.
This is my second entry on a game jam, I hope you enjoy playing this game as much as I enjoyed making it.
